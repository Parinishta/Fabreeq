        <h2>Types of Stitches </h2><br>
        <h4>The Various Types of Hand Stitching</h4>
          <p>Of course, knowing some basic sewing stitches by hand comes in handy when you don’t have access to a sewing machine, but that’s not the only reason you might want to turn to these stitches. Many sewers prefer basic sewing stitches by hand when they’re dealing with delicate fabrics or looking for more control. These stitches to sew by hand also let you create flawless corners and more intricate details. Getting a handle on these different sewing stitches on clothes can make a world of difference when it comes to your sewing projects. 
            </p>
            <b>Running Stitch</b><br>
                The running stitch is one of the most basic types of hand stitches, and it has many variations. It’s used for gathering, mending, and tucking. Depending on its use, you can either knot your thread or take a couple of back stitches to lock it into place. In its longer form, it becomes a basting stitch.Bring your needle through the fabric from the back (wrong side). Once the knot hits the fabric, make a stitch to the left or right. Bring the thread back up and repeat.<br><br>
               <b>Basting Stitch</b> <br>
                Use the same technique as the running stitch, but make longer stitches (between 1/4 inch and a 1/2 inch).Today, we tend to pin baste more than hand baste our garments and projects, but hand basting can still be useful, especially with both lightweight (silk and chiffon) and heavyweight (leather and Melton) wools.<br><br>
                <b>Backstitch</b><br>
                Before sewing machines, all clothes were built by layer upon layer of backstitches. This is one of the most practical hand stitch to know.Working from left to right, take a small stitch, then insert the needle at the end of the previous stitch, bringing it out beyond the point where the thread emerges. Continue, always inserting the needle in the end of the previous stitch.<br><br>
               <b>Catch stitch (Cross-Stitch)</b> <br>
                You can use this stitch to to finish hems with fabric that doesn’t fray, and to tack facing invisibly.Working from left to right, take tiny stitches on the hem, and then on the garment. Keep the stitches loose and even. They will appear as crosses on the wrong side and small stitches on the right.<br><br>
                <b>Slip Stitch</b><br>
                This stitch is my go-to stitch when it comes to hems and other finishes. It’s tidy and almost invisible, when it’s done right, and with care on both sides. Once you get the hang of it, this stitch will be one of your favorites, too.Bring the needle through the fold of the hem and pick up a thread of fabric at the same point. Make the stitches about a 1/2 inch apart and fairly loose.<br><br>
               <b> Blanket Stitch (Buttonhole Stitch)</b><br>
                If you want to sew eyelets or buttonholes by hand, learn the buttonhole stitch.Secure the thread on the wrong side of the fabric, then with the right side facing upward, insert the needle from back to front through the fabric 1/8 inch from the edge. Wrap the working head around behind the eye end of the needle, then behind the point. Pull the needle through, bringing the knot to the fabric edge. Continue, making closely spaced stitches and knot.The eyelet version is worked in a circle, with the wrapped edge to the inside; the blanket stitch variation has at least a 1/4 inch spacing between stitches.<br><br>

                <h4>Sewing Machine Stitches</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you have an understanding of basic hand sewing stitches, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with some of the most common sewing machine stitches. After all, using a sewing machine allows you to make stronger and more durable stitches. It’s also easier to use a sewing machine when you’re working with heavier fabrics. Follow our sewing techniques machine stitch guide below for help mastering these stitches, and you’ll be all set to take on some easy sewing projects, such as headbands and drawstring bags. <br><br>
                   <b>Standard Forward / Backward Stitching</b> <br>
                    Begin straight stitching 1/8-3/8 inch from the fabric edge. Backstitch the forward stitch over the pinned or basted seam. Repeat the reverse stitch to finish.You can use the straight stitch for seams, under stitching, stay stitching, and simple top stitching.<br><br>
                    <b>ZigZag Stitch</b><br>
                    The zigzag stitch provides a clean finish to raw edges, and you can use it as a finish technique in combination with a stay stitching line. You can adjust both the width and length of this stitch to fit the needs of your project. For example, use this stitch if you’re hemming jeans with a sewing machine.<br><br>
                    <b> Buttonholes</b><br>
                    The good news is that most sewing machines can make buttonholes, either with a fully-automatic buttonhole foot attachment, or in the case of some mechanical and most computerized machines, a pre-programmed buttonhole.Check your machine’s manual for these details.<br><br>
                    <b>Blind Hem Stitch</b><br>
                    This sewing machine stitch consists of two or three straight stitches, and then one wide zigzag/catch stitch. Just as in the hand-stitched version of the blind hem, the fabric is folded under and away with the hem edge just projecting.
