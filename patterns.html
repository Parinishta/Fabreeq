        <h2>Patterns and Textures</h2>
        <p> Mixing patterns in fashion can be very challenging because you always risk looking clownish, going overboard with your look's brightness, or highlighting your body.<br><br>
            Including a striking pattern or print in your outfit is the simplest way to convey that you've carefully considered your attire. All repeating patterns design is called patterns, but the mixed prints fashion trend is patterns printed on fabric rather than woven or embroidered.
            </p>
            <h4>Rules for mixing patterns with clothes</h4>
            <p><b>1.	Select two distinct pattern types.</b> When pattern-mixing, allowances will mostly depend on the kinds of pieces, texture and patterns, settings, colors, and other elements in the outfit. The rule applies if you join more than two pieces with a similar design. Pretty bestsellers mixed pattern dress options can be found at the Milla store.<br><br>
             <b> 2.	Adjust pattern scale and size. </b>  Selecting two pattern sizes—one large and one small — is usually advised. This will give the clothing depth and ensure the patterns complement one another rather than clash. While small patterns must be seen to be appreciated, large patterns are easily discerned from a distance. Take a look at the Milla collection of floral dresses, combining patterns.<br><br>
             <b> 3.	A single bold, a single subtle.</b>  The interest level of an outfit is already increased when multiple patterns are worn, and wearing two bold patterns together is likely too much. However, they are frequently the most daring; larger patterns are only sometimes.<br><br>
                Think about their placement within mixed print dresses and their color and contrast. You are welcome to observe wonderful dresses that combine textures and patterns and are specially designed for the most cherished events.

                <h4>Texture</h4>
                   <p> Texture in fashion design refers to the surface interest of a fabric, influenced by the weave and light reflection. Our eyes delight in the interplay of light on smooth or rough surfaces, while our hands can feel the textures.<br><br>
                    Some adjectives used to describe textures are smooth, fuzzy, furry, shiny, dull, bulky, rough, crisp, heavy, and thin. The texture of the fabrics depends on many factors, like the quality of the fibers, the process used in making fabrics, or finishes applied to the fibers, yarn, or fabrics. The texture of the finished garment can be changed by different fabric manipulation techniques (ruching, smocking, trapunto, etc.).
                    </p>  
                    <h4>Understanding the Key Factors Influencing Texture</h4>  
                    <p>
                        Texture in fashion is influenced by four factors.<br><br>
                        1.	Fabric Content<br><br>
                        2.	Yarn Structure<br><br>
                        3.	Fabric Structure <br><br>
                        4.	Finishes<br><br>
                        These elements determine the visual, tactile, and performance qualities of a texture. In today's fashion trends, texture is a vital element that significantly impacts the overall visual effect and appearance of a garment. From delicate chiffon to cozy fleece and sturdy canvas, understanding texture is crucial for creating captivating designs. This understanding of the dynamics of texture helps individual consumers and fashion professionals make better decisions as they select apparel products and items of personal adornment.
